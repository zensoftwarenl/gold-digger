# Gold Digger 🎮

Gold Digger is a retro-style casual mining game inspired by the classic *Digger*. Built with React, TypeScript, and Canvas, it features pixel-art animations, tile-based movement, enemies, collectibles, and a decorative banner.

This project is implemented using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for lightning-fast development and modern tooling.
